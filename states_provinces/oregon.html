        <h2>Geography</h2>

        <p>Oregon's scenery is nothing short of breathtaking. From the rugged cliffs and sandy shores of the Pacific
            coastline to the snow-capped peaks of the Cascade Mountains, the state offers an unforgettable backdrop for
            any adventure. Crater Lake, with its deep blue waters, feels almost otherworldly, while the Columbia River
            Gorge delights with cascading waterfalls and endless hiking trails. Whether you're wandering through lush
            forests, exploring high desert plains, or relaxing in a quiet valley, Oregon's landscapes are as diverse as
            they are beautiful.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>Oregon's history adds depth to its natural beauty. For thousands of years, Indigenous tribes like the
            Chinook, Klamath, and Umatilla called this land home, leaving a lasting cultural impact. The arrival of
            pioneers along the Oregon Trail in the 1800s marked a new chapter, filled with tales of perseverance and
            exploration. The Lewis and Clark Expedition, which passed through the region in the early 1800s, further
            highlighted Oregon's significance in westward expansion. Today, you can step back in time at places like the
            Lewis and Clark National Historical Park in Astoria or explore the exhibits at the Oregon Historical Society
            Museum, both offering rich insights into the state's past.</p>

        <h2>Cities & Culture</h2>

        <p>Portland, Oregon's largest city, is known for its vibrant arts scene, diverse culinary offerings, and
            commitment to sustainability. With its unique neighborhoods, extensive park system, and renowned coffee
            culture, Portland embodies a creative and progressive spirit. Salem, the state capital, offers historic
            charm and beautifully maintained gardens. Eugene, home to the University of Oregon, thrives with youthful
            energy, arts, and outdoor activities. Bend attracts outdoor enthusiasts year-round with its abundance of
            recreational opportunities, while Medford, located in the Rogue Valley, is celebrated for its wineries and
            scenic beauty. Cities across Oregon add to its diverse appeal, offering something for every traveler.</p>
