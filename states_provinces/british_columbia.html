        <h2>Geography</h2>

        <p>British Columbia is a province of extraordinary natural beauty, defined by its diverse and dramatic
            landscapes. From the rugged Pacific coastline with its rocky shores and misty inlets to the towering peaks
            of the Coast and Rocky Mountains, the province offers an unparalleled outdoor experience. The ancient
            forests of the Great Bear Rainforest shelter some of the oldest and tallest trees in the world, while the
            crystal-clear waters of Okanagan Lake provide a stunning contrast to the rolling vineyards of the
            surrounding valley. In the north, vast wilderness areas remain largely untouched, offering a glimpse into
            Canada's raw and untamed nature. Whether exploring alpine trails, kayaking along jagged shorelines, or
            unwinding in the picturesque wine country, British Columbia's landscapes are as diverse as they are
            breathtaking.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>The province's history is deeply rooted in both Indigenous cultures and early European exploration. For
            thousands of years, Indigenous Nations such as the Haida, Coast Salish, and Nlaka'pamux have lived in
            harmony with the land, developing rich traditions that continue to thrive today. European contact began in
            the late 18th century, with explorers like James Cook and George Vancouver mapping the coastline. The Fraser
            River and Cariboo Gold Rushes of the 19th century brought an influx of settlers, shaping many of the
            communities that exist today. British Columbia's history as a fur trading hub, its eventual entry into
            Canadian Confederation in 1871, and the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway all played crucial
            roles in its development. Today, visitors can immerse themselves in the past by exploring Indigenous
            cultural centers, historic trading posts, and Gold Rush-era towns like Barkerville.</p>

        <h2>Cities & Culture</h2>

        <p>Vancouver, the province's largest city, is known for its stunning waterfront setting, multicultural vibrancy,
            and thriving arts and technology sectors. Nestled between the mountains and the ocean, it offers an urban
            experience deeply connected to nature. Victoria, the capital, blends colonial-era architecture with coastal
            charm, while Kelowna and the Okanagan region are famous for their wineries, orchards, and warm climate.
            Whistler, one of the world's premier outdoor destinations, draws visitors year-round for skiing, hiking, and
            mountain biking. In the north, Prince George serves as a gateway to the province's vast wilderness, offering
            adventure and solitude in equal measure. Whether enjoying the cosmopolitan energy of Vancouver or the
            tranquility of the remote coastline, British Columbia offers a unique combination of culture, history, and
            natural wonder.</p>
