        <h2>Geography</h2>

        <p>Idaho's landscapes are striking and varied. From the towering peaks of the Rocky Mountains to the wide-open
            plains and meandering river valleys, the state is a haven for those who appreciate natural beauty. The
            Sawtooth Mountains, with their rugged summits and pristine alpine lakes, are a notable feature of the
            landscape, while the Snake River carves through deep canyons, providing a sense of both grandeur and
            serenity. Remote wilderness areas, like the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, offer some of the
            most untouched and rugged terrain in the country. Whether you're navigating through dense forests, exploring
            vast desert landscapes, or unwinding by one of Idaho's countless lakes, the state's diverse scenery invites
            exploration at every turn.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>The history of Idaho is as rich and varied as its landscapes. Indigenous peoples, such as the Nez Perce,
            Shoshone, and Bannock tribes, have called this land home for millennia, cultivating deep connections with
            the environment. The arrival of European settlers in the 19th century saw the rise of fur trading, mining,
            and agricultural settlements, all of which contributed to the state's development. The Lewis and Clark
            Expedition passed through the region in the early 1800s, setting the stage for westward expansion. The
            discovery of gold in the mid-1800s brought a flood of miners and adventurers, forever altering the region's
            economy and culture. Today, sites like the Nez Perce National Historic Park, Shoshone Falls, and the Idaho
            State Historical Museum allow visitors to explore and reflect on this significant history.</p>

        <h2>Cities & Culture</h2>

        <p>Boise, the state's capital and largest city, offers a blend of urban sophistication and easy access to
            nature. Known for its burgeoning tech sector, vibrant arts community, and emphasis on sustainability, Boise
            captures the essence of Idaho's forward-thinking spirit. Idaho Falls, located along the Snake River, is a
            charming city surrounded by natural beauty, while Coeur d'Alene, situated next to its namesake lake, is
            known for its stunning views and outdoor recreation opportunities. Twin Falls, with its iconic Shoshone
            Falls, attracts visitors looking to experience both natural wonders and small-town charm. Meanwhile, Sun
            Valley is renowned for its world-class ski resorts and year-round outdoor activities, making it a top
            destination for adventure seekers. From Boise's urban offerings to the scenic beauty of Idaho's outdoor
            treasures, the state's cities and landscapes provide a perfect mix of culture, history, and adventure.</p>
