        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>Glass Beach, located near Fort Bragg in Northern California, is a hidden gem on the rugged Pacific coastline.
            This small beach is renowned for its colorful sea glass that blankets the shore, a result of years of
            natural weathering. The beach offers stunning views of the ocean and is surrounded by dramatic cliffs, rocky
            outcrops, and tidal pools teeming with marine life. The unique combination of coastal beauty and the
            sparkling sea glass makes it a photographer's dream and a haven for beachcombers.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Glass Beach's fascinating history dates back to the early 20th century when the site was used as a dumpsite
            for glass, metal, and other refuse. Over time, the elements transformed the discarded glass into smooth,
            colorful pieces that now decorate the beach. After the site was closed to dumping in the 1960s, efforts to
            preserve the area began. Today, Glass Beach remains a symbol of nature's resilience and the passage of time,
            drawing visitors from all over the world to witness its beauty.</p>

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>The town of Fort Bragg, where Glass Beach is located, has a charming small-town feel, with a mix of outdoor
            adventures, historical sites, and local businesses. Fort Bragg is home to a variety of shops, galleries, and
            restaurants, many of which highlight the region's coastal heritage. While Glass Beach itself is a major
            draw, visitors also enjoy exploring the nearby coastal trails, parks, and the famous Skunk Train. With its
            eclectic mix of history and nature, Glass Beach embodies the spirit of Northern California's rugged coast.
