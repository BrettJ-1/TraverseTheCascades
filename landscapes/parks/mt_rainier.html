        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>Mount Rainier, located in Washington State, is an iconic and majestic volcano that rises 14,411 feet above
            sea level, making it the tallest mountain in the Cascade Range. The mountain is part of the Mount Rainier
            National Park, which covers over 369 square miles of rugged terrain, including glaciers, alpine meadows, and
            dense forests. The peak of Mount Rainier is covered in year-round snow, and its glaciers feed into the
            surrounding rivers and streams. The surrounding national park offers stunning views of the mountain from
            various angles, making it a popular destination for hikers, climbers, and nature lovers looking to explore
            the diverse ecosystems and dramatic landscapes that characterize this striking peak.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Mount Rainier has been a significant landmark for indigenous peoples for thousands of years, particularly the
            Puyallup, Nisqually, and other tribes who have historically lived in the area. The mountain, known as
            "Tahoma" or "Tacoma" by these groups, is a central figure in their cultural and spiritual practices.
            European exploration of Mount Rainier began in the mid-19th century, with the mountain being named after the
            British naval officer Peter Rainier. The first successful ascent of the mountain occurred in 1870, and since
            then, it has become a major destination for mountaineers and adventurers. In 1899, Mount Rainier was
            designated as a national park, making it one of the oldest national parks in the United States. Its history
            reflects the region's natural beauty, its significance to indigenous peoples, and its growing importance as
            a national treasure.</p>

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>Mount Rainier holds a special place in the cultural identity of Washington State. The mountain is often
            featured in local art, literature, and even the state's official symbols. It attracts visitors year-round,
            offering a wide range of activities, from hiking and camping in the summer to skiing and snowshoeing in the
            winter. The surrounding national park is home to diverse wildlife, including elk, black bears, and a variety
            of bird species, making it a prime spot for nature enthusiasts and wildlife photographers. The mountain also
            plays a role in the region's local economy, drawing tourists and climbers from around the world who come to
            experience its beauty and challenge its slopes. With its cultural significance, natural beauty, and outdoor
            recreational opportunities, Mount Rainier remains a cherished symbol of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
