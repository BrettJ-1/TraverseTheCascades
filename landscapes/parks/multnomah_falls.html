        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>Multnomah Falls, located in the Columbia River Gorge of Oregon, is one of the most famous and breathtaking
            waterfalls in the Pacific Northwest. The falls cascade 620 feet, making it the tallest waterfall in Oregon
            and the 2nd tallest year-round waterfall in the United States. The falls have two distinct drops, with the
            upper fall dropping 542 feet and the lower one an additional 69 feet. Surrounded by lush, green forest and
            dramatic cliffs, Multnomah Falls is easily accessible from Interstate 84, making it a popular stop for
            visitors. The beauty of the falls is especially stunning during the spring and early summer months when the
            surrounding foliage is vibrant, and the water flow is at its peak after the snowmelt in the mountains.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Multnomah Falls has been a prominent feature of the Columbia River Gorge for centuries, with the area
            historically inhabited by the Multnomah and Chinook Native American tribes, who revered the falls as a
            sacred site. The falls were named after the Multnomah tribe by European settlers in the 19th century. In
            1925, the construction of the Multnomah Falls Lodge helped to establish the site as a major tourist
            destination. The falls have since become a symbol of the natural beauty of the Columbia River Gorge and a
            popular spot for both locals and visitors. In 1986, the falls were included in the Columbia River Gorge
            National Scenic Area to preserve the surrounding landscape and ensure its continued protection for future
            generations.</p>

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>Multnomah Falls holds a special place in the cultural identity of the Pacific Northwest, serving as both a
            natural wonder and a major tourist attraction. The falls are featured in numerous local artworks,
            photographs, and postcards, and are considered one of the most photographed natural sites in Oregon. The
            area surrounding the falls offers visitors a chance to experience the beauty of the Pacific Northwest
            through hiking trails, such as the iconic trail that leads to a bridge overlooking the falls. In addition to
            outdoor enthusiasts, the falls attract photographers, artists, and nature lovers, making it a hub for
            cultural activities. The falls also host seasonal events, including ranger-led tours, which educate visitors
            about the natural and cultural history of the region. With its combination of natural grandeur and cultural
            significance, Multnomah Falls remains one of the most beloved landmarks in Oregon.</p>
