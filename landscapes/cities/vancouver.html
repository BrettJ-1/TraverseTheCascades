        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Vancouver's history dates back thousands of years, with the area originally inhabited by Indigenous groups,
            including the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations. European exploration of the region began in
            the late 18th century, and the city was founded in 1886 as a major port for trade and transportation.
            Vancouver quickly grew into a bustling metropolis, fueled by the development of the Canadian Pacific Railway
            and its strategic location on the Pacific coast. Over the years, Vancouver evolved from a small settlement
            into one of Canada's most diverse and rapidly growing cities, attracting immigrants from around the world
            and becoming a hub for international trade, tourism, and culture.</p>

            atmosphere. The city boasts a thriving arts community, with numerous galleries, theaters, and festivals
