        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Portland's history dates back to the 19th century when it was founded in 1845, named after Portland, Maine.
            Originally a small trading post, the city quickly grew due to its strategic location along the river, which
            made it a key hub for shipping, transportation, and trade. Throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s,
            Portland developed a strong industrial economy, with a focus on lumber, shipping, and railroads. By the
            mid-20th century, Portland began to diversify, and today it's known for its thriving arts, tech, and food
            scenes, while still retaining much of its historic charm and character.</p>
